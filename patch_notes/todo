- add asleep message
- add command to put rob to sleep so that talking to him won't work, and he will only wake up when he hears a heardle message
- make it so patch notes will only print when asked
- potentially add a way to quit and add a message that triggers "i'm going to sleep" when you do that
- potentially change endless if tree to switch case tree

#DONE need to make it so that rob doesn't reply to commands in his own mf patch notes
#DONE basically none of the previous fixes worked
#DONE completely change logic so that all commands require /rob to activate
