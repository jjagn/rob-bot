patch notes for version 2
- rob can now sleep, and will not respond to messages unless someone wakes him. he will still track scores and reply to heardle messages while asleep
- rob can be woken up by saying 'wake up rob' in chat. 'goodnight rob' will put him to sleep
- 'are you here rob' will now cause rob to reply with 'yes', or 'zzz' depending on what state rob is in
- rob's commands are now all case insensitive
- rob will only print patch notes if he is awake and someone says 'patch notes please rob'

#HOTFIX
- there was a bug in the message reading code it's gone now
- improved logic on goodnight rob command to prevent him saying hey immediately after being told to go to sleep
- rob now actually doesn't send patch notes unless aasked
- rob now doesn't respond to commands in his own mf patch notes
- rob will now reply to messages that begin with rob
- rob will now try to answer questions
- improved rob's reply logic so he hopefully doesn't reply to a message more than once (i think)
